Magic 8 Ball
Story:

As a user I can enter a question on a web page and magically get an answer to my question. Tasks:
Create an array with the following answers: Yup!, Fuhgeddaboudit, Maybe, Ask: what would your mother do?, Ask: what would an Australian do, then do the opposite, Your answer here.
Input a question from the user.
Create a random number to select one of the answers (hint: use Math.random() and change the magnitude).
Output the question with the random answer.
Put the question and answer into a loop that stops when the user enters STOP.
Car
Story 1:

Add (model) year, and a method that returns make, model and year as one String and use the method to tell the user. Story 2:
Constrain the maximum speed to not exceed 85. Try taking it above 80 and see what happens. Story 3:
Use a while loop to take speed up to 70, then use a while loop to brake down to 0. Surprise: it doesn't stop at 0, fix that. Story 4:
Sometimes roads are slippery and downhill, and sometimes brakes fail: make the brake change the speed with a random amount with a maximum of plus or minus of the current speed. (Hint: try Math.random();)
